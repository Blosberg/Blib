This repo contains Various general functions I've written, and don't want to have to write again.
These are purely for self-reference, purely for my own purposes to have saved somewhere for quick reference. If you find anything useful here, you are free to use these for your own scholarly purposes (provided you give credit), but I provided ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE. 
These are my own messy functions for my own messy, internal purposes. Use at your own risk.
